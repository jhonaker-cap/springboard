# Springboard Capstone Project for Machine Learning Engineering

This repository documents my Springboard Machine Learning Engineer capstone project.  This 
project involved the full lifecycle of data collection, analysis, wrangling, and modeling. 
The project adapts a Bert-based model to be used for classification of text from 
dozens of publicans.  It was built using both AWS and Google Cloud.
